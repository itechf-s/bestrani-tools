        questionName: `How do I calculate my basal metabolic rate? `,
        acceptedAnswerText: `<p>Your basal metabolism rate is produced through the following basal metablic rate formula: Men: BMR = 88.362 + (13.397 x weight in kg) + (4.799 x height in cm) – (5.677 x age in years) Women: BMR = 447.593 + (9.247 x weight in kg) + (3.098 x height in cm) – (4.330 x age in years).</p>`

      {
        questionName: `What is a good basal metabolic rate?`,
        acceptedAnswerText: `<p>Your BMR score is a number which refers to how many calories you burn at rest. Most people's BMR is between 1000 – 2000. This means that they need to take in between 1000 – 2000 calories each day to fuel their basic functions while in a resting state.</p>`
      },
      {
        questionName: `What is a normal BMR for a woman?`,
        acceptedAnswerText: `How Important Is Your BMR/BEE? Typically about 60% of our total energy needs come from resting metabolism (see above), but this varies greatly depending on our activity level. The average BMR for an American woman is about 1,400 calories, while for a man its about 1,800.`
      },

      {
        questionName: `Why are BMR calculators so different?`,
        acceptedAnswerText: ` That's a lot of room for error if BMR is your primary tool to assess your caloric requirements. Your BMR can vary dramatically from another person who is the same age, height and weight as you. This is because there are many variables that affect how your body uses energy.`
      },
      {
        questionName: `How many calories should I eat if my BMR is 1500?`,
        acceptedAnswerText: `You never want your total caloric intake to be less than your BMR. If your BMR is 1500 calories, you should never eat less than 1500 calories in a day.`
      },
      {
        questionName: `How do I increase my BMR to lose weight?`,
        acceptedAnswerText: `<p>5 ways to boost metabolism</p>
        <p>1. Exercise more. Add interval training to your cardio routine and burn more calories in less time.</p>
        <p>2. 5 Weight train. Add muscle mass to your body and you can burn more calories at rest.</p>
        <p>3. Don't skip meals, especially breakfast</p>
        <p>4. Eat fat-burning foods.</p>
        <p>5. Get a good night's sleep every night</p>`

      title: `How To Calculate Your BMR Manually`,
      description: `<p>To calculate BMR, you need to check your height and weight and analyze your activity level. If you are aware of all these parameters, you can calculate your BMR manually using the following equations.</p>
      <p><b>BMR For Men</b></p>
      <p>BMR (metric) = (10 × weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm) – (5 × age in years) + 5</p>
      
      <p>BMR (imperial) = (4.536 × weight in pounds) + (15.88 × height in inches) –(5 × age) + 5</p>
      <p><b>BMR For Women</b></p>
      <p>BMR (metric) = (10 × weight in kg) + (6.25 × height in cm) – (5 × age in years) – 161</p>

      <p>If you want to lose weight, you need to reduce your intake by 500 calories per day, which is enough to lose 1-2 pounds per week or so based on your activity level.</p>
