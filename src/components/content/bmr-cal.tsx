      {
        questionName: `How do you calculate BMI for males and females? `,
        acceptedAnswerText: `<p>Body Mass Index is a simple calculation using a person's height and weight. The formula is BMI = kg/m2 where kg is a person's weight in kilograms and m2 is their height in metres squared. A BMI of 25.0 or more is overweight, while the healthy range is 18.5 to 24.9. BMI applies to most adults 18-65 years.</p>`
      },
      {
        questionName: `What is the normal male and female BMI range?`,
        acceptedAnswerText: `<p>Broadly speaking, irrespective of whether you are male or female, a BMI in the range of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered normal.</p>`
      },
      {
        questionName: `How is BMI calculated?`,
        acceptedAnswerText: `BMI is calculated using only the variables of weight and height. Your BMI is equal to your weight in kilograms divided by your height in metres squared. You can also calculate your BMI using imperial units, in which case your BMI is equal to your weight in pounds divided by your height in inches squared, multiplied by 703. See the BMI page for these equations and for further information on the Body Mass Index. To calculate your own BMI, use our BMI calculator.`
      },
      {
        questionName: `Can BMI tell me how much weight to lose?`,
        acceptedAnswerText: `Yes, BMI can indicate how much weight you ought to lose, and correspondingly (for those who are underweight) it can indicate how much weight should be gained. While the variables in the BMI equations can be re-ordered to calculate this, a much simpler way is to use the KiwiCover BMI calculator. For people who are not in the healthy weight range for their gender and ethnicity, the calculator automatically calculates the number of kilograms by which their weight should be either reduced or increased, in order to achieve a weight which is just inside the healthy weight range.`
      },
      {
        questionName: `What BMI categories are there?`,
        acceptedAnswerText: `The five principal categories for BMI are detailed in the BMI Categories and Ranges section of the main BMI page. That section contains a table which provides an example of BMI categories and ranges based on New Zealand European males and females, but it is important to note that this is an example only. While category descriptions remain the same, BMI ranges tend to differ according to ethnicity, and those differences can be significant. That is why ethnicity is an important factor in the KiwiCover BMI calculator.`
