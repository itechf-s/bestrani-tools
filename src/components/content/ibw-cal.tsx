        questionName: `What does ideal body weight mean?`,
        acceptedAnswerText: `Ideal body weight (IBW) refers to how much a person should weigh according to his or her age, gender, height and other factors. There are various formulas to determine the ideal body weight of a person, such as the Robinson formula, Miller formula, Devine formula and Hamwi formula. IBW only gives an estimate and may not be strictly applicable universally.`

      {
        questionName: `Whats is the factor for calculation?`,
        acceptedAnswerText: `While calculating IBW, factors such as body fat or muscle mass aren’t taken into consideration. Therefore, it is not a perfect measure of the health of a person. Conditions such as obesity, malnutrition and heart diseases, among others, can lead to health complexities. Maintaining an ideal body weight can help people avoid such complexities and ensure better health.`
      },
      {
        questionName: `What should be my ideal body weight?`,
        acceptedAnswerText: `Generally, IBW isn’t a definitive factor to determine a person’s health. BMI or body mass index is a more precise factor that is used medically for diagnosing health-related conditions. Originally, ideal body weight was used by doctors to determine medication dosages appropriate for a person. However, IBW can be used to maintain proper body weight and avoid weight-related medical issues.`
