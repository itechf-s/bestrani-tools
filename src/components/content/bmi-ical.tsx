        questionName: `How do I calculate how much protein I need?`,
        acceptedAnswerText: `<p>Calculate protein requirement by weight.Dividing your weight into pounds by 20 and multiplying it by seven. You need just a little more than seven grams of protein for every 20 pounds of your body weight. Thus, for someone weighing 200 pounds, the protein requirement will be 70 grams each day.</p>`

      {
        questionName: `How do I calculate how much protein I need in kg?`,
        acceptedAnswerText: `<ul>
        <li> Weight in pounds divided by 2.2 = weight in kg.</li>
        <li> Determine your protein number; Mildly Active = 0.8, Regularly Active = 1.5, Heavily Active = 1.8.</li>
        <li> Weight in kg x 0.8-1.8 gm/kg = protein gm.

        questionName: `What is a gram of protein?`,
        acceptedAnswerText: `In nutrition science, “grams of protein” refers to the number of grams of the macronutrient protein, not the number of grams of a protein-containing food like meat or eggs. An 8-ounce serving of beef weighs 226 grams but only contains 61 grams of protein.`

      {
        questionName: `How much protein is too much?`,
        acceptedAnswerText: `Most research indicates that eating more than 2 g per kg of body weight daily of protein for a long time can cause health problems. Symptoms associated with too much protein include: intestinal discomfort and indigestion. dehydration.`

        questionName: `How do you know if your body needs more protein?`,
        acceptedAnswerText: `Swelling. One of the most common signs that you're not getting enough protein is swelling (also called edema), especially in your abdomen, legs, feet, and hands. A possible explanation: The proteins that circulate in your blood -- albumin, in particular -- help keep fluid from building up in your tissues.`

      title: `How Much Protein Do We Need?`,
      description: `<p>The amount of protein required depends on the age, sex, and physical activity of the person. The current International Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for protein is 0.8 g/kg body weight, irrespective of age.</p>

      <p>As per the American Dietetic Association, the protein requirement depends on the age and physical activity of a person.</p>
      <ul>
      <li> No Exercise to Low Exercise: 0.8-1 g/body weight</li>
      <li> Little to Moderate Exercise: 1-1.8 g/body weight</li>
