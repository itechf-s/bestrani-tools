        title: `What is Calculator`,
        description: `It is an electronic device. It makes the difficult calculations so easy and on tips. The machine is fully equipped with the functionality of solving various problems. For example, Addition, subtraction, Multiplication and Division. Above all, it is no more related to these four functions only. More functional and technical devices are available to give a great experience to the user.`,

        title: `History of Calculator`,
        description: `The importance of this helpful tool was known in the early times. At that time, early men use bones, pebbles and other objects to tally the calculations. 
        But, it was very limited in nature. So, when the first mainframe computers came into existence. It was using vacuum tubes and transistors. That leads to stepping stones to develop an electronic calculator. Therefore, the first electronic calculator was launched by Casio computer company in 1957. followed by a series of models with compact technology. Some leading manufactures opted for this technology to cover this new market. Like Canon, Sony, Toshiba, Olivetti, etc.
