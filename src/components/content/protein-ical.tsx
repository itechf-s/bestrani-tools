      title: `How does this age calculator work?`,
      description: `<p>India, as a country, is an amalgamation of cultures where various types of traditional calendars are followed. Prominent among them include the Saka Samvat, Vikram Samvat, and the Hijri calendar. But, when it comes to official purposes, the Gregorian calendar is the calendar used in India as well as various countries around the world.
      </p><p>
      This calculator also uses the Gregorian calendar to make calculations. A year is divided into 365 days in this calendar, except for a leap year, which has 366 days. The total number of days in a calendar year is categorized into 12 months of varying lengths. Each month either has 30 or 31 days, except February which has 28 days in a normal year and 29 days in a leap year.
      </p><p>
      The system used by this calculator is the most commonly used age system. In this calculator, a person’s age starts from zero and the person turns one year old only after 12 months have passed. Similarly, in any type of age calculation here, the age is increased by one year after the completion of 12 months from the birth date/start date.<p>
